### Project Description
This project is a Women Safety Panic Button System using ESP8266 NodeMCU and NEO-6M GPS module. It allows users to send emergency alerts with their real-time location to Telegram (via Telegram Bot API).

### The Problem statement
Women often face unsafe situations where they need immediate help, but calling or texting someone manually can be difficult in an emergency
### The Solution
A wearable panic button that, when pressed, instantly shares the user's GPS location to the respective telegram bot via GPS module for real-time tracking and immediate action.
